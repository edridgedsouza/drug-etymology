Find the etymological roots of generic drug names based on the INN stem list

Credit to the INN stem list for all roots and definitions: https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/who-emp-rht-tsn-2018-1

Also credit to the developers of [pscript](https://github.com/flexxui/pscript) because I would rather not learn JavaScript if I can help it
