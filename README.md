Caveat: these are not perfectly accurate. For instance, "penicillin" is marked as an NO2 derivative because of the -ni- substring, and "estradiol" is marked as an iodine containing compound because of the -io- substring. This is not meant to be a definitive list but a best guess based on the published INN guide.
