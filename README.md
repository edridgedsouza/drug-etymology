Credit to the INN stem list for all roots and definitions: https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/who-emp-rht-tsn-2018-1

Also credit to the developers of [pscript](https://github.com/flexxui/pscript) because I would rather not learn JavaScript if I can help it.

Caveat: these are not perfectly accurate. For instance, "penicillin" is marked as an NO2 derivative because of the -ni- substring, and "estradiol" is marked as an iodine containing compound because of the -io- substring. This is not meant to be a definitive list but a best guess based on the published INN guide.
